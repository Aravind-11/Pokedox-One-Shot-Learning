## Abstract 
The process of learning good features for ma- chine learning applications can be very compu- tationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototyp- ical example of this is the one-shot learning set- ting, in which we must correctly make predic- tions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity be- tween inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discrimina- tive features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely new classes from unknown distributions. Using a convolutional architecture, we are able to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art perfor- mance on one-shot classification tasks.
## Intuition
The term Siamese means twins. The two Convolutional Neural Networks shown above are not different networks but are two copies of the same network, hence the name Siamese Networks. Basically they share the same parameters. The two input images (x1 and x2) are passed through the ConvNet to generate a fixed length feature vector for each (h(x1) and h(x2)). Assuming the neural network model is trained properly, we can make the following hypothesis: If the two input images belong to the same character, then their feature vectors must also be similar, while if the two input images belong to the different characters, then their feature vectors will also be different. Thus the element-wise absolute difference between the two feature vectors must be very different in both the above cases. And hence the similarity score generated by the output sigmoid layer must also be different in these two cases. This is the central idea behind the Siamese Networks.
