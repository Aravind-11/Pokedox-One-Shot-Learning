## Abstract "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition"
The process of learning good features for ma- chine learning applications can be very compu- tationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototyp- ical example of this is the one-shot learning set- ting, in which we must correctly make predic- tions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity be- tween inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discrimina- tive features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely new classes from unknown distributions. Using a convolutional architecture, we are able to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art perfor- mance on one-shot classification tasks.
